## Requirements
- Currently the project is in basic working shape. The below features will be added:
- system will generate `short_url` based on the given `long_url`
- clicking the `short_url` will redirect to the main `long_url`
- the link will be as minimum as possible `(minimum 7 charaters, maximum - 10 characters)` 
    - Optional - users can create custom url with maximum character limit of 16
- the generated `short_link` will remain in the system lifetime.
    - Users can create custom time limit based on `Date Range`
    - Users can also provide how many times the links can be clicked feature
